# Django OAuth2/OIDC example

This project includes examples of authentication via OAuth2.0 and Open ID Connect using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and the [Django OAuth Toolkit](https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit). We also include an example of the OIDC service authenticating users over LDAP using [Django Auth LDAP](https://github.com/django-auth-ldap/django-auth-ldap).

There are 3 server implementations (one for plain OAuth2.0, one for Open ID Connect, and one for Open ID Connect with LDAP), as well as 1 client that can login to any server.

Follow the README files in each folder to set up and run the respective applications, starting with the servers.
